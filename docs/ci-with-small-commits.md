# Continuous Integration with Small Commits

## Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) with small commits ensures that changes are
integrated frequently and rapidly. This practice helps maintain a stable and
up-to-date codebase while minimizing merge conflicts.

## Why Commit Small Changes Quickly?

1. **Immediate Feedback:**

   - Small commits trigger quick feedback from automated tests.
   - Developers are alerted early about issues, making them easier to resolve.

2. **Conflict Reduction:**

   - Frequent commits reduce the risk of large merge conflicts.
   - Small changes are easier to merge and review.

3. **Team Collaboration:**

   - A shared, current codebase ensures all team members work on the latest
     version.
   - This avoids duplication of work or efforts based on outdated code.

4. **Debugging Simplicity:**
   - With smaller changes, identifying the cause of bugs becomes straightforward.
   - The commit history is granular and descriptive.

## Writing Tests for Each Change

Testing is crucial to ensure the stability of small, frequent commits:

- **Unit Tests:** Validate the functionality of individual components.
- **Integration Tests:** Confirm that changes work with other parts of the
  system.
- **Continuous Testing Pipeline:** Run tests automatically after each commit to
  catch issues early.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Commit Messages:**

   - Clearly state what each commit does.
   - Example: `fix(auth): resolve token validation bug`

2. **Focus on Incremental Changes:**

   - Keep commits small and focused on one task or bug.

3. **Ensure Code Coverage:**

   - Write tests for all added or changed functionality.

4. **Leverage Automation:**
   - Use CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to automate build and test
     processes.

## Conclusion

Small, frequent commits with tests improve collaboration, maintain stability,
and reduce risks. A disciplined CI process fosters a productive and reliable
development environment for everyone.
